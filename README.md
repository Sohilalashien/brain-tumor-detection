# brain-tumor-detection


This application is designed for the detection of brain tumors in medical images. It utilizes machine learning techniques to analyze MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) scans and identify potential tumor regions.

## Overview

The Brain Tumor Detection application is built using deep learning models and image processing techniques to assist medical professionals in the early detection of brain tumors. It takes MRI scans as input and outputs predictions highlighting potential tumor regions.
The model was given an accuracy of 0.998

## Features

- **MRI Scan Analysis:** Upload MRI scans for automatic analysis.
- **Tumor Detection:** Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models to identify potential tumor regions.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive graphical user interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow`
- OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python`
- Additional dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Installing Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Apk
The application can be used in an easy way, where an x-ray image is inserted and then the user will get the result of whether yes, is there a tumor or not.
